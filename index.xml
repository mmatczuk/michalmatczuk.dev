There are many reasons to be excited about generics in Go. In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;m going to show how, using the generics, we got a 40% performance gain in an already well optimized package, the Google B-Tree implementation.
A B-Tree is a kind of self-balancing tree. For the purpose of this blog post it&amp;rsquo;s sufficient to say that it is a collection.</description></item><item><title>Kleptopia: How Dirty Money Is Conquering the World, Tom Burgis</title><link>https://michalmatczuk.dev/books/kleptopia-how-dirty-money-is-conquering-the-world-tom-burgis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://michalmatczuk.dev/books/kleptopia-how-dirty-money-is-conquering-the-world-tom-burgis/</guid><description>Money is transformed to power and back to money.

it needs to come is a form of spray Chemical shells, explode quietly, small dose of explosive to form a mist / spray Absorption through skin takes lots of time If enemy is well trained and prepared (have gas masks and protective clothing) tactical benefit is limited There is paint detecting chemical weapons as well as special devices Sarin is heavier than air, it can poison ppl hiding in shelter from traditional shells Typical tactic from Syria employ using Sarin to get ppl out of shelter and shelling them with conventional weapons Persistent / non persistent agents Sarin and tabun are not persistent agents - they quickly disappear Water is used for decontamination There are other persistent agents XV and Novichok to name a few Persistent agents can be used to contaminate equipment or land</description></item><item><title>Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams, Matthew Walker PhD</title><link>https://michalmatczuk.dev/books/why-we-sleep-unlocking-the-power-of-sleep-and-dreams-matthew-walker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://michalmatczuk.dev/books/why-we-sleep-unlocking-the-power-of-sleep-and-dreams-matthew-walker/</guid><description>Falling asleep Circadian rhythm is over 24h, and it is aligned to 24h with day light (melatonin) Evening melatonin üìà Morning melatonin üìâ Blue light reduces level of melatonin Adenosine is a central nervous system neuromodulator that has specific receptors When adenosine binds to its receptors, neural activity slows down, and you feel sleepy Caffeine acts as an adenosine-receptor antagonist i.e. it binds to these same receptors, but without reducing neural activity Caffeine half life is approx.</description></item><item><title>Adult children of emotionally immature parents, Lindsay Gibson PsD</title><link>https://michalmatczuk.dev/books/adult-children-of-emotionally-immature-parents-lindsay-gibson/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://michalmatczuk.dev/books/adult-children-of-emotionally-immature-parents-lindsay-gibson/</guid><description> Emotional work is use of empathy + foreseeing + self-control to foster relationship Emotionally immature ppl Are phobic of emotions, think like afraid of snakes Choose short term comfort over what makes sense in a long run (like a child) Were often emotionally deprived as children Pair with other emotionally immature ppl You can learn how to manage relations with them (it‚Äôs not going to be profound) Emotionally deprived children Cannot understand the deprivation Feel lonely Quickly become self-reliant, grown over their age Try to change to adjust to a role -

We released ScyllaDB Manager 1.0 to help our users manage repairs in February 2018. Since then a lot of things have changed. We added the row-level repair to ScyllaDB Open Source NoSQL Database, and to the Enterprise version this year. We just released ScyllaDB Manager 2.2 with a new repair method optimized for row-level repair.

When offices close due to COVID-19 pandemic, many more of us will work from home, perhaps for the first time. Some people are thrilled about this idea. In social media you can find opinions like Coronavirus Will Make it Hard to Go Back to the Office after Experiencing the Benefits of Remote Work. While the benefits they highlight are true it looks to me like an advertisement for remote work, completely disregarding costs and the downsides of it.</description></item><item><title>Gocqlx: A Productivity Toolkit for Scylla in Go</title><link>https://michalmatczuk.dev/posts/gocqlx-a-productivity-toolkit-for-scylla-in-go/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://michalmatczuk.dev/posts/gocqlx-a-productivity-toolkit-for-scylla-in-go/</guid><description>This blog post has been first published in ScyllaDB blog.
Gocqlx is an extension to the Go Scylla / Apache Cassandra driver Gocql. It aims to boost developer productivity while not sacrificing query performance. It‚Äôs inspired by jmoiron/sqlx, a tool for working with SQL databases, but it goes beyond what sqlx provides.
For this blog post, we will pretend we‚Äôre a microblogging service and use the following schema:
CREATETABLEtweet(timelinetext,iduuid,texttext,in_reply_to_screen_nametext,in_reply_to_user_idbigint,PRIMARYKEY(timeline,id));Gocql is a very popular Cassandra driver for the Go programming language.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://michalmatczuk.dev/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://michalmatczuk.dev/about/</guid><description>About Hi!

I&amp;rsquo;m leading a group of four University of Warsaw (mimuw) students. The work is their BS thesis. The goal is to implement a lock-free driver with smart memory usage (GC sympathy). Initial results look very promising.

HTTP tunnels are also great for exposing applications running locally to the outside world; even if you don&amp;#39;t have a public IP.</description></item><item><title>Talks</title><link>https://michalmatczuk.dev/talks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://michalmatczuk.dev/talks/</guid><description>Reflection (slides) Tour of reflection, the good, the expensive, and the insecure. This talk is based on my experience while working on scylladb/gocqlx, an ORM for Scylla (and Cassandra). I also show 80-90% performance gain using &amp;ldquo;generics&amp;rdquo; (2019) in scylladb/go-set.
Adventures with SSH (slides) I present how to use SSH daemon as HTTP reverse proxy, and SSH as HTTP transport. This setup was used in Scylla Manager 1.x and was removed in Scylla Manger 2.</description></item></channel></rss>
