* Communication
  * Quality of your life is defined by quality of your communication with … yourself (…and with others)
  * That is assigning meaning to events
    * What?
    * What does it mean?
  * Body language
    * 7% - words
    * 38% - tonality
    * 55% - posture
* Action
  * Intelligence does not produce results, action does
  * Prerequisites
    * Energy
    * Skill to know what you want
    * Skill to know what others want, and fulfill that with grace
  * Keep trying
    * Cornel Sanders (KFC founder) failed on first 1009 attempts to sell his franchise
* 7 disciplines of success
  * I always act from the Personal Power, there are no failures there are only outcomes
    * I always succeed to produce an outcome
    * Experience = Learning = Different Outcomes
  * I take full responsibility for my life
    * If it was otherwise if things went wrong what can you do?
  * I always stretch myself
    * Put yourself on a line
    * Do things you did not think you could do get inspired
  * I’m committed to unconscious competence rather that cognitive understanding
    *  You do not have to understand everything about sth to act on it and produce results
  * I always act from personal integrity
    * I do what I believe is true, but the beliefs may change
  * The meaning of communication is response that I get
    * You body may send signals you did not anticipate, take the feedback
  * I’m committed to WIT (Whatever It Takes) to succeed
    * Commitment vs Interest
