title: "Kleptopia: How Dirty Money Is Conquering the World, Tom Burgis"
---

* Money is transformed to power and back to money. Think of getting a loan using it to bribe and steal elections, once in the position of power reap the country and get 1000X return on the investment. Eliminate the opposition and continue the kleptocratic dream ever after…
* Privatization of power, money == power, who has money has power ultimate dictatorship of the rich (oligarchs). It’s impossible to have money if you do not have power, not a “free enterprise”
* Dictatorship
    * Two law orders: normal order facilitating making business, state (sudo) order i.e. state can override any law rules any time. The latter is hidden and needs to disguise as the former but effectively state gets what it wants
    * Money solves 90% of the problems if it does not violence does
    * Psyops and fear as means of operation, with that regard Social media is dream tool that allows to apply psyops on a scale unimaginable before
* Doublespeak and fiction (fake)
    * If past ambushes you in the present you must change the past
    * Take two threads of truth, find void between them, fill it with desired narration, and create a big lie
* Disinformation and leaking data
    * Upload data to a website or better hacked website
    * Link it on Socials adding desired narration (repeat)
    * If needed declare it common knowledge and present in court
* USSR
    * Collapse lead to creation of oligarchs former KGB agents getting state factories, natural resources etc. for a tiny fraction of its value
    * The post 1990 stolen money need to go somewhere, you cannot keep $1B in bills
* Financial system
    * Voluntarily oblivious to origins of the money, London City (Blair), Swiss banks are eager to take money and not ask questions
        * Swiss banks’ secrecy laws said to be setup (after war) to protect Jews, in fact it mostly held Nazi money stolen from Jews
    * Banks have internal bodies guarding them against participating in money laundering, this goes agains the business and is setup to fail
    * Banks facilitate hiding money by managing fleets of shell companies (Mossack Fonseca) in British tax heavens and London
* False symmetry of states
    * West treats all governing bodies as legit states, this is very much not true
    * On a surface level it’s difficult to distinguish legally earned money hidden for tax avoidance from state stolen money
* Laundering Money
    * Laundering money is the opposite of tax avoidance, the offshore countries and others benefit from the stream of cache flowing in
    * The ultimate goal is transforming the stolen money into something legit in the west world - like a building
* Trump
    * Inherited fortune from his father
    * In debt, banks wanted to get on him
    * Felix Sater connected to RU oligarchs used Trump's name to build massive buildings (the bigger = more expensive) the better, Trump was getting 3,5%
    * They wanted to build Trump tower in Moscow, there were 3 tries, ultimately it did not happen due to winning the elections
