title: "Toxic: A History of Nerve Agents, from Nazi Germany to Putin's Russia, Dan Kaszeta"
---

* III Reich
    * Tabun and Sarin were invented by Gerhard Schrader as part of his work on bug killers in IG Faben
    * IG Faben was huge company accumulating all German chemical production capacity producing soap and other chemical products
    * The primary motivation was enhancing food production to supply food to the frontline
    * Millions of Marks invested in developments and testing of new chemical weapons
    * The work was camouflaged with chains of front companies, the production was managed by Otto Ambros
    * 1st Tabun production plant was in Dyhernfurth now Brzeg Dolny 40km from Wrocław
* Production
    * There are many issues in production, the intermediate steps give unstable, very corrosive and flammable products
    * It’s expensive, very difficult to scale to production quantities
    * Common issue was clogging pipes that needed to be cleaned, ppl died while cleaning
    * Sarin is more complicated to make that Tabun
* After the WWII
    * Americans hunted the engineering workforce and moved them to US including Schrader
    * They were very cooperative and helped establish Nerve Agent / Chemical operations / research in the US and Europe
    * When Russians were coming Germans destroyed the production plants, and few scientists fled to USSR, typically all the poisons were dumped to the river…
    * Russians were left with almost nothing and had to work from scratch, this led to creation of Novichok
* Symptoms
    * Pinpointing pupils
    * Difficulty breathing
    * Death by suffocation
    * Blue lips due to lack of oxygen
    * Atropine and ocitocine can cure it
* Field usage
    * While Sarin is very toxic all depends on application - it needs to come is a form of spray
    * Chemical shells, explode quietly, small dose of explosive to form a mist / spray
    * Absorption through skin takes lots of time
    * If enemy is well trained and prepared (have gas masks and protective clothing) tactical benefit is limited
    * There is paint detecting chemical weapons as well as special devices
    * Sarin is heavier than air, it can poison ppl hiding in shelter from traditional shells
    * Typical tactic from Syria employ using Sarin to get ppl out of shelter and shelling them with conventional weapons
* Persistent / non persistent agents
    * Sarin and tabun are not persistent agents - they quickly disappear
    * Water is used for decontamination
    * There are other persistent agents XV and Novichok to name a few
    * Persistent agents can be used to contaminate equipment or land
